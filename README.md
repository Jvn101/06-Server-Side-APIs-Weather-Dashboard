# Website Features
This website features
 * An input box where the user can enter a city name <br />
 * A search button: If an invalid city is entered the user will recieve an alert <br />
 * Previous searches are stored in a city button which the user can click on to see that citys weather again (instead of having to search the same city in the search input)<br />
 * A 'clear history' button allows the user to clear all their previous searches from the page <br />
 * If there are stored cities in local storage these will appear in the broswer even when the user refreshes the page <br />
 * When the user types in a city, a new city button is created only if that city isn't already stored (this prevents two buttons for the same city being created)<br />
